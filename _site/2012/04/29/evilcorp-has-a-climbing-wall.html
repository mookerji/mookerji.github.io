Subject: [Evilcorp] Erection Party <br /></p>

<p>Dear friends, strangers, and casual acquaintances,</p>

<p>Come witness and partake in a glorious erection! This Saturday at about noon,
my rising time, I will consummate the final thrust of what has remained the
object of my desire through long, hard times. As you'll notice in the attached
photo, I've mostly got it up in anticipation, so all that remains is to get the
wood on. Doubtless it will fit tightly in certain places, but if you're as
excited as I am, the extra friction will only intensify the passion. And even
if the spreading is severe, there's no gap that my ample supply of tumescent
caulk won't fill.</p>

<p>Everyone, this is just too much erection for me to keep to myself. There will
be hours of continuous screwing even if we all go at it at once, and after
we've nailed everything that moves we'll keep on banging until the floor
undulates with the power of throbbing tools. And that's not to mention that
there will be hundreds of tiny holes practically squealing to have big horny
nuts pounded into them--rumor has it some are yet untapped. But I promise that
won't be all: when we're done, my magnificent 17 foot hard-as-steel erection
will ready to please at a moment's notice at any time of day or night. To
celebrate we will have a luxurious dinner, light some scented candles and then
contort our bodies in lavish ecstasy until we fall back to earth.</p></blockquote>
