I write [Clojure](http://clojure.org) for a small scientific software
engineering team building agricultural yield models at the
[Climate Corporation](http://climate.com). I'm currently interested in useful,
cross-disciplinary applications of computer science, particularly where there
are opportunities for learning new techniques in statistical learning and
information retrieval.

I'm on (permanent) leave from the PhD program at the MIT Department of
Mechanical Engineering, where I studied
[novel optical devices](http://web.mit.edu/nanophotonics/), nanotechnology, and
systems for large-scale numerical simulation. I received SBs (Physics, 2009;
EECS, 2011) and an MEng (EECS, 2011) from MIT, created algorithms and software
for emerging platforms at Discovery Engine, Apple, and Raytheon BBN
Technologies.  Prior to 2012, I designed protocols and built optical sources
for [quantum communication](http://www.rle.mit.edu/qoptics/) at the MIT
Research Lab for Electronics, and was the technical director of an artificial
vision-based [robotics contest](http://maslab.mit.edu/).
