I'm a software engineer in San Francisco, broadly interested in
cross-disciplinary applications of statistics, machine learning, and
physical modeling to real-world problems.

From 2014 to 2017, I worked for [Swift
Navigation](https://github.com/swift-nav/), a GPS hardware startup in aiming to
make low cost, high accuracy positioning hardware ubiquitous and easy to use. In
2014, Swift kicked-off a frenzy around low-cost [RTK
GPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Kinematic), and was probably the
first (only?) to commercialize a [software-defined GPS
receiver](https://www.swiftnav.com/piksi-multi). Today, Swift provides safe,
[GNSS-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation) precise
positioning for surprising variety of industries in North America, Japan, and
Europe. While there, I worked on software libraries, clients/services for
streaming GNSS augmentation data, observability (of all kinds), and hiring much
of the initial technical team.

From 2013 to 2014, I wrote [Clojure](http://clojure.org) for a small
scientific software engineering team building agricultural yield
models at the [Climate Corporation](http://climate.com).  Until about
2016, I organized the
[SF Clojure Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/The-Bay-Area-Clojure-User-Group/)
and served on the board of [Clojurebridge](www.clojurebridge.org),
which organizes functional programming programming workshops for
under-indexed groups in the software industry.

My focus before 2012 was in applied physics. I received SBs
([Physics](http://web.mit.edu/physics/), 2009;
[EECS](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/), 2011) and an MEng (EECS, 2011) from
MIT. I designed algorithms and software for research groups at Apple
and Raytheon BBN Technologies, and in the intervening years, designed
protocols and optical devices for
[quantum communication](http://www.rle.mit.edu/qoptics/) at the MIT
Research Lab for Electronics.
