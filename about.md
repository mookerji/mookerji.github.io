I'm currenty working on web information retrieval and search quality at
[Discovery Engine](http://discoveryengine.com) in San Francisco, CA.

I'm on leave from the PhD program at the MIT Department of Mechanical
Engineering, where I studied
[novel optical devices](http://web.mit.edu/nanophotonics/), nanotechnology, and
systems for large-scale numerical simulation. I received SBs (Physics, 2009;
EECS, 2011) and an MEng (EECS, 2011) from MIT, created algorithms and software
for emerging hardware platforms at Apple and Raytheon BBN Technologies, and was
the technical director of an artificial vision-based
[robotics contest](http://maslab.mit.edu/).  Prior to 2012, I designed
protocols and built optical sources for
[quantum communication](http://www.rle.mit.edu/qoptics/) at the MIT Research
Lab for Electronics.
