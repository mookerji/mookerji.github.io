I'm currently at [Swift Navigation](https://github.com/swift-nav/), a
GPS hardware startup in San Francisco, CA aiming to make low cost,
high accuracy positioning hardware ubiquitous and easy to use. I'm
currently interested in useful, cross-disciplinary applications of
computer science, particularly where there are opportunities for
learning new techniques in information retrieval and functional
programming.

I previously wrote [Clojure](http://clojure.org) for a small
scientific software engineering team building agricultural yield
models at the [Climate Corporation](http://climate.com) and currently
help organize the
[SF Clojure Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/The-Bay-Area-Clojure-User-Group/).
Prior to that, I received SBs (Physics, 2009; EECS, 2011) and an MEng
(EECS, 2011) from MIT, created algorithms and software for emerging
platforms at Discovery Engine, Apple, and Raytheon BBN Technologies.
In a previous life, I designed protocols and built optical sources for
[quantum communication](http://www.rle.mit.edu/qoptics/) at the MIT
Research Lab for Electronics, and was the technical director of an
artificial vision-based [robotics contest](http://maslab.mit.edu/).
