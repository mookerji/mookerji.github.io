> Dear friends, strangers, and casual acquaintances,
>
> Come witness and partake in a glorious erection! This Saturday at about noon,
> my rising time, I will consummate the final thrust of what has remained the
> object of my desire through long, hard times. As you'll notice in the attached
> photo, I've mostly got it up in anticipation, so all that remains is to get the
> wood on. Doubtless it will fit tightly in certain places, but if you're as
> excited as I am, the extra friction will only intensify the passion. And even
> if the spreading is severe, there's no gap that my ample supply of tumescent
> caulk won't fill.

> Everyone, this is just too much erection for me to keep to myself. There will
> be hours of continuous screwing even if we all go at it at once, and after
> we've nailed everything that moves we'll keep on banging until the floor
> undulates with the power of throbbing tools. And that's not to mention that
> there will be hundreds of tiny holes practically squealing to have big horny
> nuts pounded into them--rumor has it some are yet untapped. But I promise that
> won't be all: when we're done, my magnificent 17 foot hard-as-steel erection
> will ready to please at a moment's notice at any time of day or night. To
> celebrate we will have a luxurious dinner, light some scented candles and then
> contort our bodies in lavish ecstasy until we fall back to earth.
