title: Berkeley Streets in 2024

Berkeley periodically reassesses street conditions under its [Pavement
Management Program][source_ptap_2023] and apparently distributes the results of
that survey for *entire* street network as a PDF table. This data is pretty
detailed: it includes an index of street segments, measured centerline
distances, and their most recent maintenance history (namely, the renovation and
when the project was completed). I used [Tabula][tabula] to extract this data
and posted it here: https://github.com/mookerji/berkeley-data.

There's some interesting stuff! For example, the City started doing more
preventative maintenance in 2015 (assuming this attribution is correct):

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

Renovations ebb and flow, but recent, major repaving work seems to average
~3miles/year. I have no sense of whether that typical or not!
