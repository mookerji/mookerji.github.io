# {{ page.title }}

`sca_tools` analyzes software scalability benchmarking experiments,
specifically measurements of throughput as a function of applied load
or concurrency. It is a Python library and set of command line
utilities and that will help you:

- Model and quantify throughput bottlenecks in your application
- Capacity plan
- Compare performance benchmarks for regressions

`sca_tools` relies on on Neil Gunther's
[Universal Scalability Law](http://www.perfdynamics.com/Manifesto/USLscalability.html)
as a model and [lmfit](https://github.com/lmfit/lmfit-py) to perform
model fitting. `sca_tools` differs from existing implementations (see
[Related Work](#related-work)) in a few ways:

- Emphasis on robust parameter estimation
- Support for propagation of parameter uncertanties when computing
  derived quantities, such as latency, queue size, etc.
- Support for experimental measurement uncertainty
- Written using Scientific Python libraries

See the rest on [Github](https://github.com/mookerji/sca_tools).
