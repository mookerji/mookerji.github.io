<p class="meta"> 22 December 2016 - CDMX </p>

**Terminal 2**. Dropped off M at the Aeromexico Terminal 2 and promptly went to
the International Terminal 1, arriving two hours before departure.

**Terminal 1, 12PM**. Went to the checking desk of the wrong Latin American
holding company, LATAM (my flight was with Transamerica Airlines). They were
like, "we don't have a 2PM flight to Lima, also, this is an Aeromexico flight,
you need to go check in in the other terminal" (it's true, flight had an AM call
sign). The departure gate was still in Terminal 1.

**Terminal 1, 12:05PM**. In a panic, I run to an elevator and take it to street
level, run to the taxi booth to get a taxi ticket and pay $135 pesos (US$6) to
be driven back to the other terminal. On the way, the driver gets into an
argument with an adjacent driver in Spanish (maybe they were talking smack), at
which point, the other guy spits into the car, spraying me and my bag. I roll up
the window. The driver and I have a surprisingly long conversation in broken
middle school Spanish about why I'm going to the Aeromexico terminal ("hay todo
en terminal dos, domesticos y internacionales").

**Terminal 2, 12:10PM**. I'm still panicking and without coffee. I run to the
Aeromexico terminals to try and check in, skip an offer of complementary coffee
and what can only be described as a care package of free potato chips (welcome
to Mexico). Everyone takes their sweet time with baggage and ten minutes
pass. An agent at the counter looks at my Gmail itinerary print out and actually
can't figure out what carrier I'm taking or why it has a AM call sign. "We don't
even have any Airbus planes." After some looking around she lists two different
Peruvian airlines I should look into, and that they're federated under
Avianca. "You have plenty of time, an hour and 20 minutes! Just take the air
train."

**Terminal 2, 12:40PM**. Running is hard at Mexico DFs altitude, and seeing my
heavy exhales, the guard at the airtrain lets me on. Two guys with the heaviest
American accents I've ever heard are leaning over their camo bags (they did not
vote for Hillary) and gawking at the tin roofs passing underneath the
train. This is just like every airport train you've ever been on; the
quesadillas are much closer though, but still out of reach.

**Terminal 1, 12:55PM**. Run to the Avianca check-in, and it seems like I've
actually finally made it. A lady in a red jacket takes my passport and does a
lot of computer things. I have no idea what she's doing or what her UI looks
like and it's absolutely killing me, a silent drama playing out in the back of
my mind. She looks and looks and looks and after much typing she goes over to
some other people with my passport and words are exchanged. She comes back,
speaking quickly (unlike everyone in CDMX) and then realizing that I can't speak
Spanish, indicates in English that she can book me on a flight to Bogota and
that I'll still be able to make my connection in BA. The original flight
check-in is closing and the flight is full; no seats are available.

**Terminal 1, 1PM**. Her supervisor has decided that she can't do this, because
I came to the airport late (no sob stories about the fact that no one knows what
Transamerica Airlines is. It turns out it's known as TACA.) and issues me a
standby ticket, saying I can go through immigration and hope that someone has
bailed on their seat, a seat on a full international flight just before
Christmas ("maybe they are stuck in the bathroom for something").

**Terminal 1, 1PM - 2PM**. Whereupon someone at United says that they cant help
me and hands me a real physical goddamn phone with the actual United customer
service with that eternal Gershwin piano remix. I bounce around, nervously
flicking Chrome seeing one-way tickets to USH from MEX. Lots of anxious
phoning. Avianca can't rebook because the ticket is owned by United, and United
can't rebook because they can't endorse other airlines tickets (which turned out
to be bullshit).

**Terminal 1, 2:15PM**. Holding a pending business class one-way flight on Copa,
I make my way back to United, with the some more air travel jargon under my
belt. Standing in line, an *ANGEL DESCENDS FROM THE HEAVENS*, crop cut and
brusque, sounding like she grew up in Brooklyn but lived in DF, the weirdest
accent ever. She has the air of someone who's used to talking to the frustrated
and helpless but still has a palpable passion for air travel, and ten minutes
later, decides that I can fly back to the US and THEN to Argentina ("oh there
are two airports in BA. I didn't know that. That's so cool!" "Wow, this is the
reverse of you return flight. Neat!"). Lots of technical airline drama ensues,
and at some point, I'm holding one real phone waiting so she can make another
call on another phone so that two people can agree IRL about changing my
ticket. Very analog. The guy who refused to help me earlier is sloshing about
with his tail between his legs. They exchange harsh words, and a half hour
later, exhausted from travel bureaucracy bloodsport and shuffling about on
different phones, she returns with boarding passes: "Are you checking any
baggage with us today?"

I haven't hugged a stranger that hard in quite a while.
