## Personal Life, Projects, and Travel

2022 was a dense, eventful year, interleaved with Omicron-related logistics that
became less intense as the year went on. 

### Projects

## Work: [Span Drive][span-drive]

My big work project this year was a
[soup-to-nuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soup_to_nuts) design,
implementation, and certification of the "functionally safe" embedded system
system powering [Span Drive][span-drive], an EV charger that dynamically adjusts
charging rate based on your home's electrical load.

> Warning: flagrant generalizations and lack of references ahead.

My lesson from the last year: there are **remarkably few** consumer hardware
companies and startups working to directly replace fossil-fuel-based consumer
technologies with electric ones ("electrification").

These include creating both electric equivalents (EVs and e-bikes vs internal
combustion engines, cheaper induction stoves and heat-pump water heaters, etc.),
introducing new [new product categories](https://www.span.io/panel) for
microgrid management, making more reliable [public EV charging
infrastructure][ars], or supporting the booming US residental solar industry. If
you're a Bay Area software engineer looking to join the clean energy industry,
your options are largely behemoths like
[Tesla](https://www.teamblind.com/company/Tesla/), SolarEdge, Enphase, Rivian,
etc.
  
Given this --- as well as the passage of the [Inflation Reduction Act][ira] ---
it's actually really surprising how many climate-focused startups are working on
really _indirect_ solutions_ such as creative carbon accounting, carbon finance,
monitoring, and monitoring of electric assets (like EVs). Some of these efforts
seem really tenuous ground truthing to real climate-related outcomes.

## Media, Books, Reading, etc.

I read a lot fewer books than [Zmagg](https://zmagg.com/). I don't keep a
GoodReads or other list of books I read, but these are the ones I remember:

- [Silas Marner (George Eliot)][eliot]
- [Means of Ascent (Robert Caro)][lbj]
- [A Place of Greater Safety (Hilary Mantel)][mantel]
- [Laudato Si, Encyclical on Climate Change and Inequality: On Care for Our
  Common Home (Pope Francis)][laudato_li]

My technical reading this past year was _almost_ entirely related to work:

- [The Definitive Guide to ARM Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M0+ Processors (Joseph Yiu)][arm]
- [Understanding Digital Signal Processing (Richard Lyons)][dsp]
- [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (Arpaci-Dusseau)][ostep]
- [Rust Programming Language (Blandy, Orendorff, Tindall)][blandy]
- [Renovation, 5th Edition (Litchfield and Harley)][renovation]

Most played music and radio:

- [Northwest Passage (Stan Rogers)][nw-passage]
- [Good Food (Evan Kleinman @ KCRW)](https://www.kcrw.com/culture/shows/good-food)

[nw-passage]: https://open.spotify.com/album/6GQskZhcw8OppDepxNSUSX?si=vBuV2Y0dQWaK61Nzz3Jsfg

Movies, etc.: 

- [NOPE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nope_(film))
- [Glass Onion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_Onion:_A_Knives_Out_Mystery)
- [Stranger Things (Season 1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_1))
- [Andor (Season 1)][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andor_(TV_series)]

## Food

I'm excited to do a lot more new cooking in 2023 than I did in 2022. Of note,
after three years, we finally got off the wait list for the [Rancho Gordo Bean
Club][bean_club]. I signed up in 2022 and apparently totally forgot ðŸ˜…! If you
want to come over and eat beans in 2023, send me a message!

Notable household experiments and staple from 2022 included: 

- [Homemade Tempeh][tempeh]
- [Eggplant Lasagna][lasagna]
- [Cardoon Gratin][gratin]
