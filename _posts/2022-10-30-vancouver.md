After a somewhat intense year for work, we took a one-week vacation to Vancouver
and Vancouver Island to eat and look at some big trees. We got pretty lucky --
certainly weather-wise -- on this trip! By the time we arrived on October 21, it
had only just started raining after what I heard was a six-month dry spell and
an accumulation of wildfire smoke. It was damp, but otherwise dry, for a lot of
our trip, with a few days that were simply the wettest weather I've ever
experienced. All that aside: **Definitely go!** The food is excellent, it's easy
to get around, and everyone we met was super-friendly.

Vancouver-area trip highlights and area recommendations: 

- Aberdeen Centre food court, Richmond, BC generally
  * Definitely worth a stop (just off the Canada Line). Within 1km off of
    Aberdeen Center there are at least three to four food courts and strip
    malls, covering the Cartesian product of `[Persian, Japanese, Korean,
    Sichuan, Cantonese, Hunanese, Taiwanese, Malay]` and `[Vegetarian, Vegan,
    Gluten-Free]`.
- Riley Park / Mount Pleasant. We stayed at an AirBnb in this neighborhood
  between Ontario and Main Street and it was Pretty Nice. Accessible on transit
  via TransLink 8 bus and the Canada Line. Some standouts:
  * [Liberty Cafe and Bakery](https://www.liberty-bakery.com/)
  * [33 Acres Brewing](https://www.instagram.com/33acresbrewing/?hl=en)
  * [Sushi Hil](https://www.instagram.com/sushihil_restaurant/?hl=en)
  * [Hawkers Delight](https://www.instagram.com/hawkersdelightdeli/?hl=en)
- Bill Reid Museum and Biking Stanley Park
  * We stopped at the Bill Reid museum to see some Haida First Nation art before
    heading over to Stanley Park for a rental bike ride.
- North Vancouver: Hiking in Capilano River Regional Park (skip the suspension
  bridge and hike to the salmon hatchery instead) and Central Lonsdale
  (fantastic Persian food and markets).

After about six days in Vancouver, we rented a car at the airport and took the
BC Ferry from Tsawwassen to Victoria and then drove up to Port Renfrew for a two
day stay. Some highlights:

- Ferry ride from Tsawwassen to Victoria (Swartz Bay), winding through the San
  Juan Islands ($100 for the car, $18/per person).
- Visiting Eden Grove and Big Lonely Doug with [Day Trip
  Drea](http://daytripdrea.com/hiking-day-trips-and-overnight-adventures-vancouver-island/)
  
We wanted to, but didn't get:

- [太二 酸菜鱼 ("Chinese Sauerkraut
  Fish")](https://www.yelp.ca/biz/chinese-sauerkraut-fish-richmond-3), or
  actually more regionalized Chinese food.
  * This place ferments their own mustard greens. We showed up on a Tuesday
    night, and learned they had sold out a full hour before closing.
- [Carmanah Walbran Provincial
  Park](https://vancouverisland.com/things-to-do-and-see/parks-and-trails/vancouver-island-bc-islands/carmanah-walbran-provincial-park/)
  * This is an old-growth temperate rain forest on Vancouver Island, about a
    five-hour drive on rough roads from Port Renfrew. Shockingly, many of these
    'Crown Lands' aren't protected from logging in the same way similar landmark
    forests are protected in the US. We weren't able to visit since lumber
    companies blocked https://thenarwhal.ca/topics/fairy-creek-blockade/. Read
    more about the preservation work around this forest at the [Ancient Forest
    Alliance](https://ancientforestalliance.org/).
- Indian food
  * When I made my way to Punjabi Market, it was apparently Diwali (and Rishi
    Sunak's installation as UK's PM). Two sweet shops east of Punjabi Market had
    pretty long lines for freshly fried (!) jalebi.
- Salmon season
  * Salmon are apparently spawn shortly after the rain starts, since the streams
    fill back up. Unfortunately, this is worst time to eat them (unless you're a
    hungry bear).
- [Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden](https://vancouverchinesegarden.com/),
  and really, any public gardens in Vancouver and Vancouver Island.
    
We saved links on a Google Maps list here:
https://goo.gl/maps/4UWHFxwmomW5HH9x8. Beware: places change! Restaurants and
shops in all (expensive) cities turn over eventually, so if you find these
bookmarks in the future.
  
Some tips: 

- **Getting around**. You don't need a car unless you're leaving the metro
  area. Walking, public transportation via Skytrain/bus/Seabus are pretty good
  and Vancouver's not that big. If you're planning to hike in North Vancouver,
  you can take TransLink buses (240 and 246) from Downtown Vancouver to great
  public parks, and then return via the SeaBus.
  
  You will need a 4WD SUV if planning any backcountry visits on Vancouver
  Island.
- **Food**. Like Los Angeles, Vancouver has a wide variety of really great food
  in food courts. Some of these food courts are in unexpected places. Unlike Los
  Angeles, you don't have to drive for hours to get to them. Compared to the SF
  Bay Area, it felt like there was a lot more experimentation, more broadly, as
  well as more foreign imports (like Chuan Xiang Xiang from Chengdu). Typical
  meals are also cheaper than the Bay Area and LA, but not by much.
- **Ferry logistics**. You can rent a car in Vancouver to drive on Vancouver
  Island, but you'll need to transport that car via the ferry (fare is
  $18/person, $100/car). You should definitely reserve a spot on the ferry as
  soon as you're sure about your plans, and you can check the BC Ferries
  [website](https://www.bcferries.com/current-conditions/TSA-SWB) for
  surprisingly detailed information and boat space allocations and reservation
  utilization. We were one of the last dozen or so cars let onto the ferry
  without a reservation.
  
  If returning from a distant part of Vancouver Island for a Sunday afternoon or
  evening flight, time budget for cross-island driving, potential rain and ferry
  complications, as well as weekend traffic going into Richmond.
- **Rain**. If you're planning to explore on foot during the rainy season, bring
  a drybags and/or waterproof backpack (.... or borrow a _giant_ umbrella).
